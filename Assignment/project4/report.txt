	It took me around 8 hours to complete this project.
2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.
	
   Problem 1 (Ring Buffer): ...
	
	The only problem I faced in this problem was maintaining the first, last and size variables, as these three variables are used for enqueuing and dequeuing.
 
   Problem 2 (Guitar String): ...
	In this problem the only issue was understanding and implementing the Karplus-Strong decay factor update. Which I handled by debugging and dry running the algorithm.

4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.
	This assignment was a tough but an exciting one, learning the physics behind guitar string got me going as I myself have interest in music. And actually implementing the way guitar strings work was fun.
